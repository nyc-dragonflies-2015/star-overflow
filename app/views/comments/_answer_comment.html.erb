<div class="container">
<%# this seems weird: why pass one as a local but not the other?  Just looks kinda like this: o_O and that makes me go o_O %>
<%# .... especially when you DO pass both as locals!  i.e.

app/views/questions/show.html.erb
74:          <%= render partial: "comments/answer_comment", locals: { answer: ans, comment: @comment }
104:              <%= render partial: "comments/answer_comment", locals: { answer: ans, comment: @comment }

%>

  <%= form_for [answer, @comment] do |f|%>
    <%= f.text_area :text, :size => "70x3" %>
    <%= f.submit 'Comment!', class: "btn btn-primary" %>
  <% end %>
</div>
